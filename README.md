# F1Rush
It's a web site created in Python using Flask. 
It's about Formula One, it displays the drivers and the standings from 1950 to 2023.
It also shows this year's races and the current standings. Perhaps it will be updated, we will see!
The data is obtained thanks to the **Ergast API**: http://ergast.com/mrd.
To obtain images of the drivers and circuits, Wikipedia's API is used.
